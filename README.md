By Train and Foot
=================

A photo journal I made for a train trip I took from San Francisco, California to Jasper, Alberta in 2015. I wanted to experiment with using JS and scroll events to tell a story in a more visually interesting way than a traditional static web page.

Best viewed in a desktop browser, as I've not yet made any optimizations for mobile.
